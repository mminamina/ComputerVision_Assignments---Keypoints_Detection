## ComputerVision Assignments: Keypoints Detection
Keypoints Detection Assignments
### Overview
This repository contains my work for Udacity Computer Vision Keypoints Detection, which allow me to learn, test and implement various computer vision and **OpenCV** applications 
- color changing, 
- features and edges detection, 
- segmentation,
- classification,
- feature vectors,
- **CNN** layers
